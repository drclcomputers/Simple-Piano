# Simple-Piano
A basic C++ piano emulator.

It is written in C++. It uses the conio.h and windows.h libraries for BEEPing and geting the pressed key, so I don't thik it'll work on other operating systems.
The controls are from 'a' to 'l' (each key increases the base frequency by 100Hz) and the numbers '1' to '5' raises the initial frequency by 50Hz, so 3000Hz sounds can be achieved.
I'll study more regarding the sounds made by the computer and hopefully make this demo more useful.
